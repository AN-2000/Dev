Given the template meme.html and create script.js which works with the template.
So that page when reloaded shows meme with title.
Create the script using promises 

Definitions required:

fetch => a function which takes a url and returns a promise that resolves in response.
        //On that response another method is defined .json() which returns a promise that
        //resolves in required json data 

To change img, use:
     document.querySelector("img").src = //Img-URL-String;
To change h1, use:
     document.querySelector("h1").innerText = //New-Title-String;
